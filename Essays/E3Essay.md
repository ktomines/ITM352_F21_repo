For the fourth WOD, the assignment was an invoice chart that provided sales data for five products. The WOD was to demonstrate the utilization of expressions and variables and deal with dynamic data.

My experience with this WOD was okay, it did take me a long time because I didn't assign the right values to some variables because there was so many, but eventually, I got the  hang of it.
